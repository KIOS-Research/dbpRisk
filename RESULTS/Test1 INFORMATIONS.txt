In the first case, we introduce chlorine 1 mg/L and TOC 2.5 mg/L in reservoirs. In
addition, we choose 20 celcius in each pipe and tank. Therefore, the program was run
for two dierent cases in relation with the chlorine dose. The only parameter that
varied in the second case was the chlorine dose which was 0.5 mg/L. The rest of the
parameters are the same.
